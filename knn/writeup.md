# Introduction
The k-nearest neighbors (knn) algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm with an elegant execution and a surprisingly easy implementation.
Because of this, knn presents a great learning opportunity for machine learning beginners to create a powerful classification or regression algorithm, with a few lines of Python code.
